We always have 2 more letters than we have triples in a sequence, so the expected number of keypresses is 64 + 2 = 66 and not 64.\n\nThe simulation looks good. #CompTools\n\nFor the stretch goal, this analysis oversimplifies the process of typing out a word (or genome). The calculation changes if there are overlapping sequences of letters in the word. For example, we can't simply use 4ⁿ for the sequence TAT since it starts and ends on the same letter. As a result, we would have to change how we count the possibilities for the third triple given that the first triple is not TAT. It turns out that the expected number of keypresses for TAT is 66 and not 64. Where there is more overlap, the expected number of keypresses goes up further. For example, typing CCC has an expected number of 68.\n\nAlso, it might be useful to write your final in base-10 since people are used to thinking in decimal. 4^n = 10^(n log_10(4)) = 10^96126.102... = 1.2657... × 10^96126.", 'graded_blindly': True, 'created_on': '2024-03-23T15:31:30Z', 'updated_on': '2024-03-23T15:32:39Z'}, {'learning_outcome': '#CS-ComputationalTools', 'score': 4.0, 'comment': 'This is an overall grade for your use of computational tools, including simulations, in the assignment.', 'graded_blindly': True, 'created_on': '2024-03-23T15:35:29Z', 'updated_on': '2024-03-23T15:35:29Z'}, {'learning_outcome': '#organization', 'score': 3.0, 'comment': 'The overall organization of your workbook is fine, following the original workbook structure.', 'graded_blindly': True, 'created_on': '2024-03-23T15:36:04Z', 'updated_on': '2024-03-23T15:36:04Z'}, {'learning_outcome': '#professionalism', 'score': 3.0, 'comment': 'The formatting in your workbook is fine, following the formatting of the original workbook.', 'graded_blindly': True, 'created_on': '2024-03-23T15:37:50Z', 'updated_on': '2024-03-23T15:37:50Z'}, {'learning_outcome': '#composition', 'score': 4.0, 'comment': 'Very clearly written work with correct and precise use of terminology.', 'graded_blindly': True, 'created_on': '2024-03-23T15:38:35Z', 'updated_on': '2024-03-23T15:38:35Z'}],
