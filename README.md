# Minerva Grading Dashboard
This project is an assignment grading dashboard for course leads, so that they can import the current grading data for a given assignment (across all active sections of the course) and observe differences in grading patterns between sections.

# How to use
(<em>insert how to here when finalized</em>)

# Functionality
The script will create an html file containing interactive graphs and statistical results for the given assignment across all sections.
The html will describe and summarize data like:
- ANOVA results, whether there's statistical evidence that at least one section is giving higher/lower scores
- Distribution of students' average assignment scores over all sections
- Distributions of students' LO scores over all sections
